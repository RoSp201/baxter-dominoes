Baxter Dominoes Project: EE106A Final Project

Team Members: Robert Spark, Anders Lewis

Goals: Get Baxter to Play dominoes against a human, without hardcoded motion
Using an open source gaming engine (or one homemade) make Baxter a worthy gaming adversary.



Motion Planning -- Robert

1. get baxter to move to a location in space with moveit
2. have baxter follow waypoints that do not violate constraints
3. get baxter to read in ar tag and determine correct tf
4. have baxter move to this ar tag using move it (without constraints)
5. have baxter move to this ar tag using move it (with added contstraints/ wayspoints)
